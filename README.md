## üö® Usage from Git repo

If you use this bindings from the git repo, be sure to use

```js
{
  // ...
  "bs-dependencies": [
    // bs-react-native, but compatible with jsx3
    "reason-react-native-monorepo/bs-react-native-jsx3-compat",
    // new ReactNative, WIP on zero-cost bindings
    "reason-react-native-monorepo/reason-react-native"
  },
  // When used from git with the following path, bs-platform will use path that won't be working
  // (because deps are pointing to folder in folder)`
  // Your bundler (metro or webpack) will say that it can find and/or `reason-react-native/whatever`
  // which is correct because it should be `reason-react-native-monorepo/reason-react-native/whatever`
  // the trick below will correct path in generated JavaScript files
  // and will just need to be removed when you won't use git directly anymore
  "js-post-build": {
    "cmd": "./node_modules/reason-react-native-monorepo/git-monorepo-usage-trick"
    // if this tricky script doesn't work for you correctly, try
    // "cmd": "./node_modules/reason-react-native-monorepo/git-monorepo-usage-trick-node"
  }
}
```
